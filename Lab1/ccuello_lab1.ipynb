A `while` loop will iterate until a certain condition has been met. If at any point after an iteration that condition is no longer satisfied, the loop terminates. A `for` loop will iterate over a sequence of values and terminate when the sequence has ended. You can instead include conditions within the `for` loop to decide whether it should terminate early or you could simply let it run its course."

        "Like `Series`, `DataFrames` can hold multiple types of data, but `DataFrames` are 2-dimensional objects, unlike `Series`. Each `DataFrame` has an index and a columns attribute, which we will cover more in-depth when we start actually playing with an object. The index attribute is like the index of a `Series`, though indices in pandas have some extra features that we will unfortunately not be able to cover here. If you are interested in this, check out the [pandas documentation](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.18.1/advanced.html) on advanced indexing. The columns attribute is what provides the second dimension of our `DataFrames`, allowing us to combine named columns (all `Series`), into a cohesive object with the index lined-up.\n",

In this case we have a special case of a matrix that we call a vector.
